Welcome to the "Explore Your College Campus in VR" project!

This project is a virtual reality experience that allows college students to explore NITH in a new and interesting way. Using threejs, a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser, I have created a virtual tour of the campus that can be accessed from any device with a modern web browser.
